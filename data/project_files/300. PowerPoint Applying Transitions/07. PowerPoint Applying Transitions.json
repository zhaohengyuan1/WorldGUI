"0.00 - 8.32\nGoodwill Community Foundation creating opportunities for better life.\n8.32 - 13.16\nHave you ever seen a presentation that had special effects between each slide?\n13.16 - 17.24\nIf so, you've probably seen transitions in action.\n17.24 - 22.56\nA transition can be as simple as fading from one slide to the next.\n22.56 - 28.04\nOr it can be a lot more flashy, like this animation of a bird.\n28.04 - 33.16\nYou can create all kinds of effects using the options on the Transitions tab.\n33.16 - 36.36\nStart by selecting one of your slides.\n36.36 - 40.80\nThen click the arrow here to view all of your choices at once.\n40.80 - 46.32\nTransitions are divided into three categories depending on the type of effect they use.\n46.32 - 51.24\nThe first category is subtle.\n51.24 - 57.28\nFollowed by exciting, where you'll find more complex animations.\n57.28 - 63.04\nAnd finally there's dynamic content, which will affect only the content on your slides.\n63.04 - 68.60\nThis might include texts and images, for example, but not necessarily the background.\n68.60 - 73.36\nGenerally speaking, we wouldn't recommend using too many transitions from the exciting\n73.36 - 74.64\ncategory.\n74.64 - 79.32\nSure, they look a lot more interesting than the subtle or dynamic ones, but adding too\n79.32 - 84.56\nmany can make your presentation look unprofessional and, frankly, a little silly.\n84.56 - 89.36\nUse the moderation, however, they can add a nice touch between important slides.\n89.36 - 93.28\nLet's change this transition back to a subtle option.\n93.28 - 96.32\nHow about push?\n"
